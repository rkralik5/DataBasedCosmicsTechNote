  abstract = {The Pythia program can be used to generate high-energy-physics  `events', i.e. sets of outgoing particles produced in the interactions  between two incoming particles. The objective is to provide as accurate  as possible a representation of event properties in a wide range of  reactions, within and beyond the Standard Model, with emphasis on those  where strong interactions play a rôle, directly or indirectly, and  therefore multihadronic final states are produced. The physics is then  not understood well enough to give an exact description; instead the  program has to be based on a combination of analytical results and  various QCD-based models. This physics input is summarized here, for  areas such as hard subprocesses, initial- and final-state parton showers,  underlying events and beam remnants, fragmentation and decays, and much  more. Furthermore, extensive information is provided on all program  elements: subroutines and functions, switches and parameters, and particle  and process data. This should allow the user to tailor the generation task  to the topics of interest.

The code and further information may be found on the Pythia  web page: http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html.},
